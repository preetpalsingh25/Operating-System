            <h2 class="price-text">Merits</h2>
            <p>i. Technical/Maintenance support: Support is made available either online or offline because of its general acceptability by so many users.</p>
            <p>ii. Compatibility: Windows accommodates almost every applications, game works and different types of drivers.</p>
            <p>iii. Enormous quantity of functions: Getting use to Windows, one would realize that there are many functions one can do almost anything quite easily with when call up.</p>
            <h2 class="price-text">Demerits</h2>
            <p>i. Viruses: Need to purchase an antivirus programs that needs to be activated frequently, and this can be done on Auto or Manual mode, although free antivirus exist but with limitations.</p>
            <p>ii. Slow: Windows operating system, particularly Vista and Windows 7 needs a lot of system resources like registers, cache, main memory, processor, disk space, and this makes the system runs slower.</p>
            <p>iii. Price: The cost of purchasing Windows operating system is high and very few users can afford it and this necessitate cracking and makes pirated software version available.</p>

          <div class="card-body">
            <h2 class="price-text">Merits</h2>
            <p>i. UNIX provides more control by the user.</p>
            <p>ii. On UNIX, user has no limitation as anything can be done in as much as the operating system offers it as UNIX offers both freedom and danger because the operating system can be changed and make more compatible with what one want to do.</p>
            <p>iii. UNIX, the operating system can be so powerful that it can be customized, and because it has been in used for a long time, most bugs have been cleared and this fact makes it very reliable.</p>
            <h2 class="price-text">Demerits</h2>
            <p>i. Successfully usage of UNIX requires that an expert will be needed on site. Simple installation of new products and updates may be difficult if one is not a UNIX expert.</p>
            <p>ii. Interacting with UNIX system using its command process is difficult, more difficult for a novice, this is why UNIX is most used by sophisticated users.</p>
            <p>iii. UNIX operating system is a customizable OS, different dialects and languages of UNIX are available in versions.
            For example, there was a time Berkley UNIX group were not comfortable with how UNIX classifies users, they had to change the operating system code.
            Therefore, an expert UNIX user at a domain might face a serious learning curve challenge at another domain or location.</p>

            <p>i. Price: Linux is F-R-E-E. It can be downloaded, installed, used, modified without incurring any cost.</p>
            <p>ii. Variety: Linux is nowhere a complete OS but a kernel. The fact that it is a kernel, it requires additional ad-ins in form of software. Many of these kinds of distributions or distros exist.</p>
            <p>iii. Virus: The fact that it is open sourced, it is less that itâ€™s free from virus attack.</p>
            <h2 class="price-text">Demerits</h2>
            <p>i. Complicated: A good deal of Computer skills are required to use Linux distros even when some of them are quite easy to use.</p>
            <p>ii. Compatibility: Although Linux has a few percent of the market share like Mac, however, it does not have many programs and games like that of Windows.</p>
            <p>iii. Vendors: Linux has very few vendors selling Linux computers, if one needs Linux computer, then it might be that one will need to purchase Windows computer, reformat the hard drive, and then install Linux on it.</p>
